I recently built a split planck nechanical keyboard. This is a build log of the process
from a CAD file to a finnished keyboard.

The cad models

The first step in the process was to create a CAD model of the frame for the keyboard.

Silent switches

Because of previous plans to build an ergodox, I had lots of blue gateron switches
laying around. While blue switches are nice, they are not the perfect choise for 
portable keyboards that you intend to use around others. After some googling, I found
a process referd to as jailhousing the switches.

At first I used some very thin solder wire wrapped around the stem several times. However,
this wasn't consistent and would not work every time. Luckily I had some thicker solder
wire aswell which worked out a lot better.


In the end i'm happy with the way that these switches feel, they feel a bit like
browns and blues but they have a much higher actuation point. Perhaps I will grow
to dislike them in the future but for now, they are pretty good.
